### About the game
* The objective is to destroy all the alien spaceship and avoid thier bullet.

* Click on the screen left/right of the spaceship to move left/right.

### How to run the game
* You can play the game in [this link](https://terngkub.github.io/spaceship_game).
* This game can be played by modern browsers in any device.
* Note that this game boundary is set to your window screen size. It's easier and faster to make the screen small. Smartphone size is the best in my opinion.

### How to run the game locally
* Clone or download the repo.
* The game requires to run in virtual host. For PHP, you can create it with below command in the root directory of the repo. Change the port if there is a port conflict.
	```
	php -S localhost:8080
	```
* Open the browser. You can access the game by
	```
	localhost:8080
	```
* You can also create virtual host with other tools. It's just that the browsers don't allow you to run javascript from local files.
